## Introduction

The outcome of the project is a fully functioning web app with the ability for managers, staff and members who have a membership to utilize the system to achieve their goals far more efficiently than they previously had done due to the change from paper management to paperless. An aspiration of this project is creating a user-friendly intuitive interface to complete tasks easier.

The software will allow Modern Fit to handle the user digitally with less effort as the user will be able to sign up without the help of staff member being always on site. In addition, Modern Fit will be able to display all their services online for potential clients.

Staff members will be able to create custom workout plans for each member, who can view it easily on their mobile devices to progress in their workout plans.

Staff members will also be able to create custom events such as group workout and can view and take part in it.

Overall, the software will make managing the gym much easier as it will be accessible everywhere, even outside of the gym.

### Project Objectives

- Eliminate the need for ModernFit to use any other system to aid in the management of their gym.
- Make it easier and faster for ModernFit to register new members so that they can scale their business.
- Make it easier for members to track their progression and log their workouts and meals so that more customers wish to register with ModernFit, thus netting them greater profits.
- Make it easier for ModernFitâ€™s various branches to share their data with one another as they scale up their business.
